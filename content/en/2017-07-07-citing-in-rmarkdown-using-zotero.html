<h2>Motivations</h2>
<p>The advantage of using Rmarkdown as a replacement of Word, libreoffice or other editors is tremendous and perfect in my current workflow, in which R coding, visualization are recorded for reproducibility and presentation.</p>
<p>For reports, manuscripts written in the academic style, sufficient reference is important because <del>we are scientist and that’s what we do!</del> all arguements should be backed up by evidence. In order to make the citation process painless, I did the following process and works for me (for now).</p>
<p>The motive behind doing this is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human beings should automate repetitive works and focus on things of real importance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, the best practice in adding citations should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding to organize documents by hands;
<ul>
<li>zotero is better for this job</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Avoiding to manually edit info in citations and the reference list;
<ul>
<li>zotero + citr</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Easy to adjust reference styles;</p></li>
<li><p>plain-text based enabling version controls;</p></li>
<li><p>separating citation file with the main manuscript;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Comparing to two alternative strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>word/libreoffice writer + zotero</p>
styling all those fancy stuff is distracting, slow, and disaster-prone.</li>
<li><p>latex + zotero</p>
<p>//////////////////////////////////////everywhere. Although latex enables flexibility, the learning curve for mastering latex in writing pretty and professional documents is steep. The necessity is open to discuss.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Rmarkdown + zotero is best suited for my need by providing a set of simple grammars to form organized hierachichal structure, which looks pretty in either html,pdf, word, or plain .rmd too!</p>

<div id="setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Install Rstudio, R, Zotero standalone version</p>
Rstudio can be used as an text editor(although I also prefer lots of useful features and themes in sublime text 3). Zotero for reference management, which is free (Looking at <a href="http://endnote.com/buy">endnote</a>, seriously endnote?? beefy 300 dollars??), academically based (looking at <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-Mendeley-and-Zotero-compare">mendeley</a>) and has a lovely add-on on my beloved Chrome browser because I prefer reading papers on the web instead of pdfs <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>(looking at everybody else)</li>
<li><p>R Packages required: citr</p></li>
<li><p>Zotero plugin: betterbibtex</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And it’s all set.</p>

<div id="workflow-of-adding-citations" class="section level2">
<h2>Workflow of adding citations</h2>
<p>Here is a typical scenario in my writing experience where citation is needed.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Plan to write a topic or a section in the manuscript; Search a bunch of related papers, select &amp; read them roughly, organize them in my own word.Add useful articles in my zotero library, <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=zotero+tutorial">lots of tutorials</a> are available;</p></li>
<li><p>Write the part;</p></li>
<li><p>At each point where a citation is needed, use <code>Addins-Insert citations</code>, add citation to the paper.</p></li>
<li>Edit YAML to include the bibtex file (eg:
bibliography: ./references.bib); add <code>## reference</code> at the end of the main text;</li>
<li><p>knit into pdf or html.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>basically you can click on citations in line, and the ref will pop up, instead of scrolling back and forth in pdfs<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
</ol>
</div>
