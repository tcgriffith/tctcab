<h2>Hmmm</h2>
<p>During the process of writing the report with the help of my supervisor, it is frequently required for several rounds of revision, such as the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>I write the first version in Rmarkdown, compiled in pdf<br />
</li>
<li>I send PDF to my supervisor<br />
</li>
<li>He makes changes and send it back to me<br />
</li>
<li>I make changes again, compile a new pdf and send it back</li>
</ul>
<p>He is like (-_-)#, because there’s no track-change for my new made changes in pdfs</p>

<h2>Trackchange is important</h2>
<p>I use git for the version control during writing but my supervisor don’t, neither rmarkdown.</p>
<p>I have planned to suggest him to use github’s <code>history</code> to track changes, after some digging, I think its experience is worse than that of track-change in word. I find it not worth recommending at all. Although the github history can view different changes in a lot of ways, but none of them are satisfyingly good enough for collaborative editing documents where track-change is a must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rmarkdown source files doesn’t have figures or tables. The experience of reading a source markdown file is like -_- <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>For the diff function in github/rstudio is not good enough:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s not intuitive or user friendly. and you have to have a github account!</p></li>
<li><p><code>history-unified/split</code>: whole paragraph is shown. Because they are lengthy, one can’t find the “actual” changes made <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. This maybe useful in coding but useless in tracking changes in documents. And the comment or specific lines? useless as well.</p></li>
<li><code>display the rich-diff</code>: changes are displayed nicely. However:
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t have the comment feature (even though it’s bad)</li>
<li>It may fail sometimes, showing “nahh we can’t diff this for ya”.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary the version control of git is really a bad idea for track-changes for documents.</p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Tell my supervisor to pickup rmarkdown, &amp; github, and send him the sourcefile.
<ul>
<li>I don’t think forcing my supervisor to learn git or rmarkdown and all the fancy stuff is a good idea.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rmarkdown can knit to word
<ul>
<li>after changes are made to the word, you have to work on the word after the first round, so what’s the purpose?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I WILL FALL BACK into the abyss of word.</li>
