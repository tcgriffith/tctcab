<p>One of the subject in my field, is termed “driver discovery”, which aims to prioritize those genetic or epigenetic mutations that contribute to tumorigenesis, the development of malignant tumor tissue.</p>
<p>The logic behind doing this is pretty simple: if we could find those drivers, we would know how it causes cancer, we would eventually come up with a way to correct it. This follows the “bugs appeared - find and fix bugs” scenario. But what’s the big picture?</p>

<p>There are some great examples such as imatinib. The mutation of BCR-ABL fusion will cause the expression of oncogenic BCR_ABL. leukemia by. imatinib can inhibits proliferation of BCR-ABL expressing hematopoietic cells</p>
