<p>“Explain it like I’m five”</p>

<p>For a starter, it might be interesting to see what my classmates (undergrad period) are doing with their research, and try to explain it with my shameless, shallow, short-sighted, lack-of-common-sense point of view.</p>

<li><em>Natural selection can favor the evolution of ratchet robustness over evolution of mutational robustness</em> <span class="citation">(1)</span>

<li>I read about the abstract and didn’t get it. What’s Muller’s ratchet and epistasis?</li>

<li>Conclusion: people smoke more tends to make bold moves. they used fMRI to show that bold moves are associated with

<li>So it uses modes found in PCA to guide structural sampling, which solves some kind of bias called “tip effect” in the elastic models.</li>
