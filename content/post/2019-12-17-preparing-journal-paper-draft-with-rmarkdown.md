I've finished two papers (one published, one in preparation) this year, writing in Rmarkdown. With enough experimenting/testing with the Rmarkdown suite for scientific writing, I think it's time to write a blog to brag about this little achievement.

## My experience

## Collaboration with non-Rmarkdown ~~Muggles~~ users

## Notes for preparing a scientific manuscript with the R/Rmarkdown ecosystem.

## Rmarkdown in my research workflow

## Packages I used
