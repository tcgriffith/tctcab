Last weekend I tried to setup an c++ environment on my windows laptop.

Heard that Visual studio is great.

Went to the download link.

It asked ~20 Gigabyte.

It scared the shit out of me. 

Because I only have 20 Gigabytes left.

Nevermind. See ya visual studio.

I'll stick with the combo of `sublime text` + `g++`.
