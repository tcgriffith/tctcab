Stack overflow has been helpful to my work for a long time. 

There were several times that I attempted to make a contribution by answering questions. However, I find it difficult to do so as a rookie programmer. It appeared that most "basic, easy and common" questions had already been asked and answered. So all "later questions" naturally became harder, which requires more than a programming rookie(like me) to contribute.

I like Stack overflow and its community, but somehow it feels difficult to be part of it ([which has been addressed recently](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/)):

- If I don't contribute
    - Then I don't have "reputation".
    - Then I can't even upvote my favorite answers to show some gratitude.
    - Then I feel unhappy, realizing that SO prevents me from being a good person.

So I determine to work towards 100 reputations on SO a few weeks ago. Everyday I spend sometime to work on some questions I could manage, mostly related to R or other yihui's packages that I use(xaringan, rmarkdown, blogdown & stuff). Turns out that It only requires some time and research to make a contribution!

During this time, I've also learned a few new things! ^[[reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) is really cool to produce an R related reprex, and  `ifelse` in [R is slow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51260196/7503413)]

As of today, I've answered 12 questions in total. From which I get 316 reps, which exceeds my goal already!

I can finally upvote those answers I like.

I am happy again.
