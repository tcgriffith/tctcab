One of the subject in my field, is termed "driver discovery", which aims to prioritize those genetic or epigenetic mutations that contribute to tumorigenesis, the development of malignant tumor tissue.

The logic behind doing this is pretty simple: if we could find those drivers, we would know how it causes cancer, we would eventually come up with a way to correct it. This follows the "bugs appeared - find and fix bugs" scenario. But what's the big picture?

## Will we be able to fix the problem once we found them?

There are some great examples such as imatinib. The mutation of BCR-ABL fusion will cause the expression of oncogenic BCR_ABL.  leukemia by. imatinib can inhibits proliferation of BCR-ABL expressing hematopoietic cells 


## Do we have a clear definition of so-called "driver"
