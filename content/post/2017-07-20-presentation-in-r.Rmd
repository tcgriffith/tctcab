## A sunny

I've tried ioslide in rmarkdown before. And [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki) today. It looks pretty neat. Here is my quick note of what I have learned

My take on MS ppt / libreoffice impress / ioslide / remark(xaringan):

- MS ppt / libreoffice impress, I'll have to spend lots of time aligning elements instead of focusing on the content.

- ioslide: neat, but inserting pictures is a pain in the ass. I end up editing the picture resolutions/ inserting modifying code into it.  which is contrary to the reason I went for rmarkdown in the first place: care less about the format.

- xaringan: better so far, but a bit complicated than ioslide. I'll give it a try next time and see if there's new problems

# basics

## page separator
- use `---` to separate pages

- use `--` to inherit content in previous page, for incrementally adding points

## page property
- class property: align the entire slides, including `left`, `center`,`right`,
`top`, `middle` and `botom`

- layout property is a bit tricky, avoid it.

## export

- exoprting it to a pdf has some issues, use dectape.js as :

```
system("phantomjs decktape.js slides.html slides.pdf")
```

## figure
- figures are rendered greater than ioslide^[it does not fit into the slide]


## layout
- column by column:

```
---
.pull-left[some stuff]

.pull-right[some other stuff]
---

```

- footnote:

```
blablabla<sup>*</sup>

.footnote[[*] Not really. See next page.]
```

- alignment element
    - pics and text works too.
    
```
.right[![Right-aligned image](https://i.imgur.com/y4kNQKa.jpg)]
.right[Right-aligned text]
```

## presentation control

- press h for an reminder

## issues

hmmm I'll come back if I run into any issues.
