<h2>One Document to Rule Them All</h2>
<p>I have to admit that writing in rmarkdown feels luxurious. It’s like a little toy that I cherish and can’t wait to share <del>and show off</del> in front of other buddies.</p>
<p>It has <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf">simple grammars which can be mastered in 10 minutes</a> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html">kicking-ass outputs</a>, which achieved a balance between simplicity and functionality that I have long dreamed of. I can’t be more happier moving from MS echosystem to rmarkdown.</p>
<p>Github is another thing I find interesting and useful. Version control is one thing, the door to the open source world full of excitings is another<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>And it’s getting better! Besides writing a experiment log, creating a ppt, writing a book and writing a thesis, now it’s even possible to maintain a personal blog!</p>
<p>By combining blogdown,github and netlify, it’s possible to write a blog in rstudio by exploiting rich format controls in rmarkdown, then push it to github, and netlify synchronizes the blog site with your repo in a neat and satisfying way!</p>
<p>Now I can save more time for <a href="/post/2017/07/11/time-management/">being lazy</a></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In the era of information, BBS and blog sites seems to have faded away, been replaced by social networks, which are full of short, fragmented information tailored for fast-paced lifestyles. But I don’t care. I like this little toy named blogdown, I know it’ll benefit me in the future.</p>
<p>Then I did it, and I’ll maintain my little blog for myself.</p>

<p>I saw plenty of <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Blogdown</a> tutorials around. Maybe I’ll do mine while I’m more familiar with how to play with it.</p>
